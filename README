Some times you want to cut text file from A colomn to B colomn for N number of rows, rather then making a awk/sed secript try this script for vertical copy and paster,

  Move curser where you want to perform rectangle copy press Ctrl-C and move again your curser to place where to you want to copy to buffer Press Ctrl-C again.

  Now you take curser to line where you want to paste it vertically and press Ctrl-Y.
